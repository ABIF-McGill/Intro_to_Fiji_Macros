# Intro_to_Fiji_Macros
A 2-hour interactive workshop on learning how to program and write your own macros in Fiji.

# What you need for this workshop

Please make sure you have Fiji downloaded and installed on your computer, or download Fiji for your operating system [here](fiji.sc) - make sure it is Fiji, not simply ImageJ, since Fiji is easier to work with.

**Please download the demo image sets from this repository** click on the green Code button, and then "Download ZIP". Then, you can extract images (ending in .tif) in Windows / OS X.

## Why do biologists write macros/script in Fiji?

Fiji allows you to manipulate image data in a myriad of ways to extract biologically relevant information from microscope images. Writing macros can help streamline data processing, extraction and analysis.

Quite simply, the goal of writing macros is the reduce the amount of work and number of clicks required by the user to process images and extract meaningful information. Two main benefits emerge from such streamlining: 1) it makes data processing or analysis much easier, or much less daunting, 2) it can reduce the frequency of human error when analysing multiple images, by reliably applying the same sequence of functions on a set of images. 

As an added indirect benefit, learning how to write macros in Fiji is often an easier and more pragmatic introduction to the basics of programming for scientists without an extensive background in programming or computer science. 

This is a pretty broad goal. This can mean performing the same task over and over on a folder of images, or reduce multiples tasks into a macro that is launched by a single click. Note that the goal is not necessarily to “automate analysis”, though automation is often sought after.
